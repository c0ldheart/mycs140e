Q: The push method from Vec in the standard libary has no return value, but the push method from our StackVec does: it returns a Result indicating that it can fail. Why can StackVec::push() fail where Vec::push() does not?

A: StackVec's storage is from fixed length stack memory, while Vec will expands its allocated memory region when necessary.
